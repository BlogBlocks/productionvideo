		<h2>The required Steps - How to Develop a Web App Game</h2>
		<span class="date"> July 22, 2016</span><br />
		<h3 class="note1">If you were curious about the Pop-Up</h3>
		<a href="#POP_UP">How Pop-Ups-are Made</a>
		<p>This is a story of How to Develop a Web App Game. It will
			include all the steps and thought processes required to create a
			successful Web App. Mind you, at this moment the App is not made. It
			is a concept and it is my first real functional web Application. As
			an avid hobbies t, I learned many computer and web technologies. I
			hove a working familiarity with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL,
			NodeJS, Mongodb, Redis, Hapi.js, AngularJS, Android Applications and
			some JQuery. I use the term a working familiarity because I have a
			good basic understanding. I have the blocks, now to cement them
			together and build a structure.</p>

		<h2>Have no Limits Dream Big</h2>
		<p>No dream has ever been reached unless it was a dream. Strange
			sounding maybe, but very true. Dream your project, then work to make
			it a reality. The Internet is an unbelievable resource and it has
			information for every skill set and level you need or wish to
			acquire. STUDY all the time. Do not start to look up how to make a
			div appear as a pop-up and wind up looking at beautiful cloud
			formations. Keep on track. Make notes, hundreds of notes. Don't be
			afraid of real paper. In fact writing ideas and even code will help
			you remember what you learn. Beware of cut and pasting. I write my
			notes in HTML and use CSS to make them look nice. That way I can link
			to resources for later use. Not only that you will re-read what you
			wrote and give yourself the visual learning tool. You also can link
			to your code in a text file.</p>

		<h2>Developing the Game or App Idea</h2>
		<span class="date"> July 24, 2016</span><br />
		<p>The hardest part by far. If you are taking this seriously buy a
			brand new notebook just for your project. Use it for nothing else. I
			use pencil and paper for that part. Also, I do not erase. I redraw
			and keep the old stuff. Never know if looking back will spur a
			memory. I actually bought a blank hard cover book. My idea was
			serious, treat it that way. I also decided to keep this Info-Diary of
			the process in hope it would help or motivate another developer.
		<h2>How FishKiss came to Exist</h2>
		<p>The idea came from the blue. My sister is an Artist. She has
			come up with these neat looking fish characters.</p>

		<img src="img/perfect-fish.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 225px;"><br />
		<p style="text-align: center;">
			After a little 'Gimp' work <br />( I am a Linux Dude Gimp is the
			Linux equivalent to Photoshop)
		</p>
		<img src="img/perfect-fish.png" style="width: 200px; height: 180px;">


		<p>
			She had sent me a few pictures and I thought how neat it would be to
			make a short stop-motion video. When I started thinking about how to
			do that, it came to mind that JQuery drag and drop would be a very
			neat way. I could make a library of images and drag and drop them on
			the screen ( in a browser of course ). <a href="start.html">Drag
				n Drop</a> If you go there, the left arrow will bring in another fish. I
			could make a div with a background then move the images and screen
			capture the Div. Stop motion Then I could Join the pictures with
			ffmpeg and make a video. It worked. It was very easy and worked
			fantastic.
		</p>

		<p>In fact it worked so well, I started on a program '
			Stop-Motion-Studio '. A browser based stop-motion video maker.
			Specially put together for non-programmers and working from a GUI. So
			anyone could easily make stop motion videos. With no programming
			experience at all.</p>
		<p>
			I had drag and drop, but no change of angle. I started looking up how
			to rotate the image and came across a site that showed how to move
			the images with buttons. <a href="move.html">BUTTONS</a> That meant
			that with only two objects I could move one with my mouse and one
			with my keyboard. As I looked at the coding I realized I could also
			move them with buttons. WOW ! On my tablet one with the right hand
			and one with the left. MMM That sounds game-like. Then came the fishy
			jitter idea. I could have other fish in the 'picture' that just kind
			of floated around:<a href="float.html">Float</a>
		</p>
		<p>I still was half in my 'Stop-Motion Studio' idea. I could see
			recording video with some preprogrammed objects AND the drag and drop
			for a few specific images, but deep inside I saw it changing fast
			into an APP.</p>

		<h2>Time as a Development factor</h2>
		<span class="date"> July 24, 2016</span><br />
		<p>Much depends on what kind of situation you are in. Do you have
			a regular job? If you want to build an App and really hope to make a
			few bucks doing it and you are not a seasoned developer, it will take
			time. I am retired and live in the Philippines. I have a goal. I
			would like to buy a house for my Filipina wife. I want the App to do
			that. So, if it takes six months, so what. I do not need the income
			to survive. It is a bonus. I am lucky and think that is the best
			situation to be in. Not to require, but to desire.</p>

		<h2>Learning image coordinates</h2>
		<span class="date">July 25, 2016</span>
		<p>
			I have to learn to read coordinates and have a reaction when two
			image coordinates match 'The Kiss". I have decided to make a simple
			game first. I will have some moving bugs and have a fish eat them.
			This is the code so far. <a href="ref/keep-move4.txt">SO FAR</a> I
			will later, or upon request post all exterior *.js files.<br /> <a
				href="js/key-press.js">key-press.js</a> is important and it keeps
			growing. As with much of this project the majority of the time is
			researching and practicing different short pieces of code. Not all js
			scripts play well together. Some of the things work GREAT alone, but
			when combined with other script 'break'. Lots of searching and
			research involved. I also am learning the JavaScript on the fly. It
			gets a bit easier every day.
		</p>

		<h2>Responding to Touch Seems to Be a Big Deal</h2>
		<p>The more I research, 'responding to touch screens and not just
			mouse clicks', the more it comes up as a problem. I Thought I had it
			working but, the delay is too long. 300ms to 500ms seem to be a short
			time, but in the</p>

		<h2>My Weird Version Tracking Has to Change</h2>
		<p>I currently I save files For example: move-image.html then when
			I am afraid I might break it I save it as move-image2.html,
			move-image3, etc. The version system was set up wisely, I need to
			adapt it when developing. It should be, and will be, from here on
			standardized. move-image-1.00.html, move-image-1.51.html,
			move-image-2.00.html, etc. Tiny changes one hundredth, larger steps.
			tenths, and big steps whole digits. Then I just remove the versions (
			Example: move-image.html ) when I like the file and use it in
			production.</p>

		<h2>Backtracking is Hard, but, thats life sometimes</h2>
		<p>I actually had everything working with buttons on touch screen.
			I did not like the buttons and went with all different code to give
			'Fancy Buttons'. A days work, for nothing my fancy buttons will not
			work on 'touch' screens .. OH Well !
		<p>
		<h2>This is neat</h2>
		<span class="date"> July 26, 2016</span><br />
		<p>Arrange a window as you like then print a PDF of the window.
			This is very neat toy to arrange the screen and then print a PDF. I
			do now know if works the same on all computers but it is really neat
			on my Linux.</p>
		<br />
		<p class="note1">
			&#60;button onclick="myFunction()"&#62;Print this
			page&#60;/button&#62;<br /> &#60;script&#62;<br /> function
			myFunction() {<br /> window.print();<br /> } &#60;/script&#62;<br />
		</p>
		<h2>The Coordinates Started</h2>
		<p>It does take patience. After two days I have finally built
			myself a couple tools to help with matching coordinates between
			objects. Still not quite what I want. All resources I find give
			'relative to window' coordinates. I want object to object. Three days
			looking and no resources found on that. The window is okay, but
			scrolling and things knock it off. I guess I could just make the
			window fixed.</p>
		<br />
		<p>
			A couple of tools <a href="toolbox/Best-Position.html">Familiar</a>
			with the exception this page a couple buttons on the top to check
			coordinates. I know when they line up now. <br />
			<a href="toolbox/tracking-with-kiss-GOOD.html">My Duck</a> this is very small script
			adaptable to put on any page to track movements.
		</p>

		<h2>The Bugs are Floating downstream</h2>

		<p>
			<a href="move3.html">BUGS</a> Darn Bugs, my first cross browser
			issue. It works well in Chrome and Opera but now in FieFox. Oh well,
			back to the drawing board
		</p>
		<p>A few giant steps today. All the css is off the HTML page all
			the JavaScript is off the page also. The HTML page looks so lean
			Everything still working fine. Might play with minimizing everything
			for fun. The actual file will be very small. It might even be Android
			App size even with the graphics. Long way to go but today was NICE.
			The code looks pretty and organized.
		<p>

		<h2>What are the best tools</h2>
		<br /> <span class="date"> July 27, 2016</span><br />
		<p>That could probably be argued forever. My poison, at this
			moment, is Vanilla Javascript, Canvas (not to render. Vanila HTML
			rendering, Css , maybe SASS for transformation)</p>
		<h2>There is a load of resources to study here</h2>
		<br /> <a
			href="https://github.com/uhub/awesome-javascript/blob/master/README.md">GIANT
			RESOURCES</a> <br />
		<h2>JavaScript-write-to-screen-code</h2>
		<br /> <span class="date"> July 28, 2016</span><br />
		<p>Here are some examples of Java-script write to screen code.
			There are several different ways to 'write to screen' with
			JavaScript. Here are some of the most commonly used methods.</p>
		<br />

		<h2 id="POP_UP">Pop-Up Alerts</h2>
		<p class="note1">
			&#60;script&#62;<br /> window.alert('So You Want to Learn JavaScript
			This is a Pop-up Window ! ');<br /> &#60;/script&#62;<br />
		</p>
		<p>The script Above caused the pop-up window you saw when the page
			opened. Basically you told the window to alert, and print a message
			in the parameter () after window.alert.</p>
		<p>It is used to pass messages and errors to the viewer.It also
			can print numbers and variables. For example it may be used to print
			an image location. Below is an example of code that was used to print
			the current location of a ' floating image '.
		<p>
			<br />
			<script>
				window
						.alert('So You Want to Learn JavaScript This is a Pop-up Window ! ');
			</script>
			<br />
		<h2>Text to Document</h2>
		<p class="note1">
			&#60;script&#62;<br /> document.write(' Now a short \"Welcome to
			Jack\'s Java Tutorials\" ');<br /> &#60;/script&#62;<br />
		</p>
		<p>Using document.write see the text below:</p>
		<br />
		<script>
			document
					.write(' Now a short \"Welcome to Jack\'s Java Tutorials\" ');
		</script>
		<br />
		<p>The text area within the parentheses will not acknowledge line
			breaks &#60;br /&#62; It writes one large paragraph. Notice the \" .
			That allowed me to use a " in the parameter area.</p>
		<p>If used in conjunction with a button it will open a new
			document ( tab ) with the text inside. Again it will appear to be one
			large paragraph in the page.</p>


		<h2>Creating Pop Up Windows with Buttons</h2>
		<p>A pop-up window, often refereed to as an 'Alert Window', may
			also be opened with a click button. Notice it sad at the top " This
			Page Says: ".</p>

		&#60;button onclick="document.write(' This is called an Alert Window
		')"&#62;POP UP &#60;/button&#62;<br />
		<br />

		<button onclick="window.alert(' This is called an Alert Window ')">Try
			it</button>
		<br />
		<h2>Writing Directing to Specific HTML locations</h2>

		<p id="demo"></p>
		<p class="note1">
			&#60;script&#62;<br /> document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
			'This prints within an \' id \' . in this case a p (paragraph) '<br />
			&#60;/script&#62;<br /> &#60;p id="demo"&#60;&#62;/p &#62; .<br />

			&#60;script&#62;<br /> document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
			'This prints within an \' id \' . in this case a p (paragraph) '<br />
			&#60;/script&#62;<br />
		</p>
		<!-- Windows Dimensions     -->
		<h2>Getting Window Dimensions</h2>
		<p>At times I need to get window dimensions. to print them on the
			screen helps me understand the movement better for my algorithms. It
			is important to make responsive screens. that means wide screen as
			well as 3:4 and mobile devices. This is how to print that information
			to screen. It is usually used within the program.</p>
		<p class="note1">
			&#60;p id="dimensionWH">&#60;/p&#62;<br /> &#60;script&#62;<br />
			var w = window.innerWidth<br /> ||
			document.documentElement.clientWidth<br /> ||
			document.body.clientWidth;<br /> var h = window.innerHeight<br />
			|| document.documentElement.clientHeight<br /> ||
			document.body.clientHeight;<br /> var wh =
			document.getElementById("dimensionWH");<br /> wh.innerHTML = "The
			Browsers Window: " + w + ", height: " + h + ".";<br />
			&#60;/script&#62;
		</p>
		<br />
		<p id="dimensionWH"></p>
		<br />

		<script>
			var w = window.innerWidth || document.documentElement.clientWidth
					|| document.body.clientWidth;

			var h = window.innerHeight || document.documentElement.clientHeight
					|| document.body.clientHeight;

			var wh = document.getElementById("dimensionWH");
			wh.innerHTML = "The Browsers Window: " + w + ", height: " + h + ".";
		</script>

		<h1>Generating Random Numbers</h1>
			<p>Random numbers are an important part of any game. They can
				provide numbers to control timers, movement, size, visibility,
				angles, any information that is not static must be generated
				'random'. Without random numbers the ability of games would be would
				be very limited. Here I will show a few ways to generate random
				numbers. That will lead us into PIDs, variators, steppers and
				floats.</p>

			<h2>Display a Random Snail Speed in Miles Per Month.</h2>
				<p id="milesPerMonth"></p>
				<button onclick="snailSpeed()">Snail Speed in Miles per
					Month</button>



<script type="text/javascript">
function snailSpeed() {
document.getElementById("milesPerMonth").innerHTML = Math.random();
}
</script>
<hr>
<h2>Auto-Generated Random Numbers</h2>
				<p>The small black number was randomly generated when you loaded
					the page. Any reload will provide a new random number. The random
					numbers generated are between 0 and 1. The 0 is inclusive the 1 is
					not.</p>

				<p id="new"></p>
				<p>To get a random number from 0 to 100, you multiply 100 by the
					random number generated by the computer. The number generated will
					probably contain a decimal as illustrated in RED. The red number
					also was randomly generated when you loaded the page.</p>
			<p id="chunkyNumber"></p>

<script type="text/javascript">
var chunky = Math.random() * (100) +(1);
document.getElementById("chunkyNumber").innerHTML = chunky;
</script>

<script type="text/javascript">
document.getElementById("new").innerHTML = Math.random();
</script>

				<hr>
				<h2>Random Whole Number Example</h2>
				<p>The big big 'gray' has nothing to do with the random number
					stuff. Thought you might be bored of the plain ol' numbers. So I
					beefed up the looks. A bit of CSS make-up. This random number is
					from 1 to . Huh ! . Magically match the range of lottery numbers.
					You win a million bucks email me.</p>
				<p id="wholeThing"></p>
				<button onclick="noCheezyFractions()">Try it</button>
				<script type="text/javascript">
function noCheezyFractions() {
    var x = Math.floor((Math.random() * 55) + 1);
    document.getElementById("wholeThing").innerHTML = x;
}
</script>
				<hr>




				<script type="text/javascript">
/**
 * Returns a random number between min (inclusive) and max (exclusive)
 */
function getRandomArbitrary(50, 100) {
    return Math.random() * (100 - 50) + 5;
}

/**
 * Returns a random integer between min (inclusive) and max (inclusive)
 * Using Math.round() will give you a non-uniform distribution!
 */
function getRandomInt(100, 500) {
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * (500 - 100 + 1)) + 5;
}

</script>
				<hr>





				<h2>Break the Boredom Make Something Move</h2>
				<p>This set designed to start with a button click, HOWEVER, it
					is 'duck soup easy' ( that means very easy ) to make it start to
					move when the page is loaded. Just use:</p>
				<br>
				<p class="note1">window.onload = function start { slidit(); }</p>
				<p>slidit() being the function I would auto-start.</p>
				<button id="oneTimeClick" onclick="slideit()">Slide</button>
				<button id="stopSlide" onClick="window.location.reload()">Stop the Sliding
					Stuff</button>
				<br /> // if the three lines below are enabled the function
				slideit() will start automatically // no startbutton is required.



				<script type="text/javascript">

function slideit() {

// prevents multiple clicks:    document.getElementById("oneTimeClick").disabled = true;
document.getElementById("oneTimeClick").disabled = true;

function noSlide() {
    clearTimeout(pxLeft);
}


    var pxLeft = 0, style = document.getElementById('squirrelCage').style;
    window.setInterval(function () {

        // increase by pxLeft 1, reset to 0 at 500
        pxLeft = (pxLeft + 1) % 500;

        // 500 total distance in px 
        style.marginLeft = (2 * pxLeft) + "px"; 
    }, 30); // repeat forever, polling every .3 seconds

}
