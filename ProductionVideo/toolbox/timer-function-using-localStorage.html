<h1>A No Pester One Time Alert</h1>
<p>GREAT NO PESTER - As quoted by W3Schools "HTML local storage, better than cookies." So good you will think it is broken. You get alerted one time and no more pop-ups from it. 
Not even a browser refresh brings it back. Clear cache history still no.</p> 
<p>Closing a browser and reopening it will not clear the storage.</p><br />
