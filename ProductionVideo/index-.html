<h1>How to Develop a Web App Game</h1><br /><br />
<h2>The required Steps - How to Develop a Web App Game</h2>
<p>This is a story of How to Develop a Web App Game. It will include all the steps and thought processes required to 
create a successful Web App. Mind you, at this moment the App is not made. It is a concept and it is my first 
real functional web Application. As an avid hobbiest, I learned many computer and web technologies. I hove a 
working familiarity with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, NodeJS, Mongodb, Redis, Hapi.js, AngularJS, 
Android Applications and some JQuery. I use the term a working familiarity because I have a good basic understanding.
I have the blocks, now to cement them together and build a structure.</p>

<h2>Have no Limits Dream Big</h2>
<p>No dream has ever been reached unless it was a dream. Strange sounding maybe, but very true. 
Dream your project, then work to make it a reality. The internet is an unbelievable resource and it has information for
every skill set and level you need or wish to aquire. STUDY all the time. Do not start to look up how to make a div 
appear as a popup and wind up looking at beautiful cloud formations. Keep on track. Make notes, hundreds of notes.
Don't be afraid of real paper. In fact writing ideas and even code will help you remember what you learn. Beware 
of cut and pasting. I write my notes in HTML and use CSS to make them look nice. That way I can link to resources 
for later use. Not only that you will re-read what you wrote and give yourself the visual learning tool. You also can
link to your code in a text file. </p>

<h2>Developing the Game or App Idea</h2>
<p>The hardest part by far. If you are taking this seriously buy a brand new notebook just for your project. Use it 
for nothing else. I use pencil and paper for that part. Also, I do not erase. I redraw and keep the old stuff. Never 
know if looking back will spur a memory. I actually bought a blank hard cover book. My idea was serious, treat it 
that way. I also decided to keep this Info-Diary of the process in hope it would help or motivate another developer. 

<h2>How FishKiss came to Exist</h2>
<p>The idea came from the blue. My sister is an Artist. She has come up with 
these neat looking fish characters. </p>

<img src="img/perfect-fish.jpg" style="width:300px; height:225px;"><br />
<p style="text-align:center;">After a little 'Gimp' work <br />( I am a Linux Dude Gimp is the Linux equivalent to Photoshop)</p>
<img src="img/perfect-fish.png" style="width:200px; height:180px;">


<p>She had sent me a few pictures and I thought how neat it would be to make
a short stop-motion video. When I started thinking about how to do that, it came to mind that JQuery drag and 
drop would be a very neat way. I could make a library of images and drag and drop them on the screen 
( in a browser of course ). <a href="003start.html">Drag n Drop</a> If you go there, the left arrow will bring in another fish.
I could make a div with a background then move the images and screen capture the Div.
Stop motion Then I could Join the pictures with ffmpeg and make a video. It worked. It was very easy and worked 
fantasic. </p>

<p>In fact it worked so well, I started on a program ' Stop-Motion-Studio '. A browser based stop-motion video maker. 
Specially put to gether for non-programmers and working from a GUI. So anyone could easily make stop motion videos.
 With no progamming experience at all.</p>
 <p>I had drag and drop but, no change of angle. I started looking up how to rotate the image and came across a site 
 that showed how to move the images with buttons.<a href="move.html">BUTTONS</a> That meant that with only two objects I could move one with 
 my mouse and one with my keyboard. As I looked at the coding I realized I could also move them with buttons. WOW !
 On my tablet one with the right hand and one with the left. MMM That sounds game-like. Then came the fishy jitter
idea. I could have other fish in the 'picture' that just kind of floated around:<a href="002float.html">Float</a></p>
<p>I still was half in my 'Stop-Motion Studio' idea. I could see recording video with some preprogramed objects AND 
the drag and drop for a few specific images but, deep inside I saw it changing fast into an APP.</p>

<h2>Time as a Development factor</h2>
<p>Much depends on what kind of situation you are in. Do you have a regular job? If you want to build an App and 
really hope to make a few bucks doing it and you are not a seasoned developer, it will take time. I am retired and live 
in the Philippines. I have a goal. I would like to buy a house for my Filipina wife. I want the App to do that. So, if it 
takes six months, so what. I do not need the income to survive. It is a bonus. I am lucky and think that is the best 
situation to be in. Not to require, but to desire.</p>

<h2>Keep A TODO list</h2>
<p>As you think of things you need TODO, list them. Use dates. When completed Mark them, and date them when done.
DO NOT get rid of items on your <a href="004TODO-list.html">TODO list</a>. </p><br>
<ul>There are several reasons for this:
<li>It is good to see progress</li>
<li>So you don't forget and think you need to do something already done.</li>
<li>Dates may make you look back because of something you learned recently</li>
<li>It is good to see progree ( yes that deserves twice )</li>
<li>You may in your learning realize you have improved on something you thought completed</li>
</ul><br />

<h2>Some neat ideas and resources</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/custom-drag-image.html"> kryogenix.org</a></p>
<p>The second entry is Ghost Image -- Fantisic ( for the right moment ) . Imagine my ' FishKiss' 
App you click the 'opposition' It responds with " Hey, You shouldn't grab me !"
this can be a neat toy:<br /></p>
Broken code:
<pre>
&#60;div id="drag-with-image" class="dragdemo" draggable="true">drag me&#60;/div&#62;
&#60;script>
document.getElementById("drag-with-image").addEventListener("dragstart", function(e) {
    var img = document.createElement("img");
    img.src = "http://kryogenix.org/images/hackergotchi-simpler.png";
    e.dataTransfer.setDragImage(img, 0, 0);
}, false);
&#60;/script>
</pre>
<p>Example:</p>

<div id="drag-with-image" draggable="true"><img src="img/perfect-fish.png" style="width:120px;height:100px;"></div>
<script>
document.getElementById("drag-with-image").addEventListener("dragstart", function(e) {
    var img = document.createElement("img");
    img.src = "img/dont.png";
    e.dataTransfer.setDragImage(img, 0, 0);
}, false);
</script>
